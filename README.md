## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Stylistically Awesome StyleSheets

### What I learned

This is the first time I've used SASS. I learned a lot, including general syntax, variables, @mixin, @extend, when to use @mixin vs @extend, and media queries.

I was also reminded that it's best to envision the architecture of the entire page before settling on an approach and starting implementation. I tried to shoehorn flexbox in to the project halfway through, and the project would have gone faster and more smoothly if I had planned for flexbox from the beginning.

### Continued development

I'm feeling comfortable with basic SASS after this project. However, I'd like to get more practice, and learn more about what I can do with it.

### Useful resources

- [SASS documentation](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - This was a clear and easy-to-read source of information that I found very helpful while getting started with using SASS.
- ["How to add SASS to your project"](https://dev.to/ak_ram/how-to-add-sass-to-your-project--32cn) - This blog post helped me understand where SASS fits in, in a mechanical sense: what exactly it does, how I should use it, and where it fits in to the workflow.
- [How to use a sass variable in nth child class](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-a-sass-variable-in-nth-child-class/) - I had originally planned to use `nth-child` to specify colors for each card's border. This article provided a clear explanation, with examples, of more advanced nth-child selectors and how to implement them in a SASS context.
- [CSS At-Rules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/css/) - This SASS-specific article showed me how to use the media query at-rule in a SASS context.
