Added colors, spacing and typography to CSS as variables and text-preset classes, based on design file.

Grouped HTML into functional groups: header/main; main divided into hgroups

Added img tags to link to svg images provided. I don't see the need to include the svg inline in the HTML because the icons are pre-colored and won't need to have their colors changed via CSS.

To add images in the bottom-right corner instead of bottom-left corner of each card: I needed an approach that didn't take the icon out of the flow. For that reason, I ruled out absolute positioning and float:right. I wrapped the images in their own divs and set the divs to display:flex; justify-content:flex-end.

Adjusted intra-card spacing using top and bottom margins on h2, p and img wrapper elements.

I want to use text-preset classes. At the same time, I don't want to rely on adding text-preset classes in the HTML - I want all the CSS rules to explicitly arise from the CSS file(s). To strike that balance, I'd like to look into using SASS or SCSS, which would allow me to @extend rules for text elements to include text-preset rules.

Installed SASS locally. Used "sass -w main.sass main.css" so that my CSS would update automatically. Copied all rules over to new SASS file from backup of CSS file.

Used nth-child (in SASS) (in combination with a @mixin) to control the differently-colored borders at the top of each card.

Added desktop media queries and mobile-specific font sizes.

Tweaked card spacing. (Added an extra spacing variable, to use in places where Figma has added extra padding, then took it out again later after implementing flexbox.)

Updated box shadow numbers and color, drawing info from Figma design file.

To get cards in position on desktop and tablet: started to plan out a grid layout, but it was going to be complex and it looked like something flexbox could handle much easier with its alignment properties. 
- Added HTML structure: a container for the middle two cards.
